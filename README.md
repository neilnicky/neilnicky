# 💫 About Me:
Hey there! I'm <b>Neil</b>, a full-stack developer currently working remotely on Next.js-based projects. I'm actively looking to collaborate on innovative and exciting projects where I can work remotely and contribute meaningfully.<br><br>Right now, I'm diving deep into mastering the T3 Stack. It's been an amazing journey so far, but what's funny is how I got into development:<br>My best friend, who's an [expert developer](https://github.com/muadpn), said, 'It's easy, dude, just jump in!' But once I jumped in, I realized just how deep and vast this ocean of tech really is 🌊!<br><br>🎯 <b>Goals & Vision</b><br>Financial Freedom: One of my primary goals is to achieve financial independence through meaningful work and projects.<br>Inspire and Give Back: I hope to inspire others and contribute positively to the world in whatever way I can.<br>🌍 <b>Hobbies & Interests</b><br>Outside of coding, I love trekking, photography, and traveling. Exploring new places and capturing moments through my lens keeps me refreshed and inspired.<br><br>I’m always open to collaborating on exciting projects, especially those that challenge me to grow. If you're working on something amazing, let’s connect and build together!!
